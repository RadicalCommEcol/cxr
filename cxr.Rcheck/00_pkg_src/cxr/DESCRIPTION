Description: Recent developments in modern coexistence theory has advanced 
    our understanding on how species are able to persist and co-occur 
    with other species at varying abundances. However, applying this 
    mathematical framework to empirical data is still challenging, 
    precluding a larger adoption of the theoretical tools developed 
    by empiricists. This package provides a complete toolbox for modelling 
    competitive effects between species, calculate fitness and 
    niche differences, and calculate coexistence regions. 
    The functions are flexible and can include covariates 
    and different fitting algorithms can be used.
