One of the design principles of `cxr` is to allow users to estimate parameters from their own models. In this vignette we show, step by step, how user-defined models can be integrated in the package.

0 - what to include for a complete set of models

* population dynamic model(s): pm_XX_...
* species fitness function: XX_species_fitness
* abundance projection:

1 - coding your model

* explain template and parameters
* family acronym may also be used to specify non-linear variants of standard families, e.g. BHNL for Beverton-Holt non-linear. Any acronym can be used.

2 - using your model in cxr

* load it into the global environment
* make a pull request for integrating it in cxr

3 - troubleshooting

* function undefined for a certain parameterization: e.g. lotka-volterra
