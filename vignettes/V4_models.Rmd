One of the design principles of `cxr` is to allow users to estimate parameters from their own models. `cxr` already includes X families of well-known population dynamic models (namely: ...). In this vignette we show, step by step, how other user-defined models can be integrated in the package.

1 - Use the following template to add you preferred model. Note that the parameter names must be respected.

--TEMPLATE--

* explain template and parameters
* family acronym may also be used to specify non-linear variants of standard families, e.g. BHNL for Beverton-Holt non-linear. Any acronym can be used.

2 - using your model in cxr

* load the model function into the global environment, and ...
* Optionally, if you think the model can be usefull for fellow scientists, we encourage to make a pull request for a potential integration it in cxr.

Note that depending on the model especification, the derivation of the fitness and niche differences may need to be tailored and both population dynamic model(s): (pm_XX_...), species fitness function (XX_species_fitness) and abundance projection are needed... blah...



NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS:
3 - troubleshooting

* function undefined for a certain parameterization: e.g. lotka-volterra
