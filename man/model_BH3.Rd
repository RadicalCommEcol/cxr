\title{Title Beverton-Holt fecundity, third model}
\usage{
model_BH3(par, param.list = c("lambda", "alpha"), log.fitness,
  focal.comp.matrix, num.covariates = NULL, num.competitors = NULL,
  focal.covariates = NULL, fixed.terms = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{vector of variable length, with the following order: first, lambda of focal sp; 
second alpha, interaction coefficients with every species; 
last, sigma value. If any element is not to be optimized, it must not be present in this vector, but rather in the \code{fixed.terms} list}

\item{param.list}{string listing parameters to optimize. Possible elements are \code{lambda}, \code{lambda.cov}, \code{alpha}, \code{alpha.cov}.}

\item{log.fitness}{log of fitness value}

\item{focal.comp.matrix}{dataframe with as many rows as observations, and one column for each competitor sp. 
Values of the dataframe are number of competitors of each sp per observation.}

\item{num.covariates}{not used in model_BH3}

\item{num.competitors}{number of competitor species}

\item{focal.covariates}{not used in model_BH3.}

\item{fixed.terms}{list with elements \code{lambda}, \code{lambda.cov}, \code{alpha}, \code{alpha.cov}. It contains parameters not to be optimized.
Each element of the list must be of its appropriate length. Note that adding an element in "param.list" will force the function
to look for it in \code{par}, and will not consider it here. In this model, \code{lambda.cov} and \code{alpha.cov} are not considered.}

\value{
log-likelihood value
}
\description{
These functions return the negative log-likelihood of the data
given the model and parameters. model_BH3 is \eqn{F_i = \frac{\lambda_i}{1+\sum_j\alpha_{ij} N_{j}}}{(lambda_i)/(1 + sum(alpha_ij)N_j)}
}
