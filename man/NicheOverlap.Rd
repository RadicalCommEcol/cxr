\title{Niche overlap between two species}
\usage{
NicheOverlap(pair.matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{pair.matrix}{2x2 matrix with competition coefficients between the two species, and intraspecific terms}
}
\value{
niche overlap value, in the range 0-1.
}
\description{
quoting Godoy et al. (2014):
reflects the average degree to which species limit individuals of their own species relative to competitors. 
Low niche overlap causes species to have greater per capita growth rates when rare than when common. 
If species limit individuals of their own species and their competitors equally, then niche overlap is 1, 
and coexistence is not possible unless species are otherwise identical. 
At the other extreme, if species have no interspecific effects, then niche overlap is 0.
