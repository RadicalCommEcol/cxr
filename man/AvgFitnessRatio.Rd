\title{Average fitness differences between a pair of species}
\usage{
AvgFitnessRatio(lambda, germ.rate = NULL, survival.rate = NULL,
  pair.matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambda}{vector of length 2, per capita fecundity of the species in the absence of competition}

\item{germ.rate}{optional vector of length 2, germination rate of the two species}

\item{survival.rate}{optional vector of length 2, annual survival of ungerminated seed in the soil}

\item{pair.matrix}{2x2 matrix, competition coefficients between the two species and intraspecific terms}
}
\value{
list with three numeric values, giving 1) the demographic ratio, 2) the competitive response ratio, and 
3) the average fitness ratio between the two species
}
\description{
Calculates the product of (1) the demographic ratio, and (2) the competitive response ratio between two species
according to their vital rates and competition coefficients. First species in the parameters is numerator 
(j in eq. 4 of Godoy et al. 2014). If germ.rate and survival.rate are provided, it calculates the ratio
according to eq. 4 of Godoy et al. (2014), for annual plants. Otherwise, if only lambda is provided, it
returns the general version of the demographic ratio, where nu = lambda
