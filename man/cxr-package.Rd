\title{cxr: A Toolbox for Modelling Species Coexistence in R}
\description{
Recent developments in modern coexistence theory have advanced our understanding on how species are able to persist and co-occur with other species at varying abundances. However, applying this mathematical framework to empirical data is still challenging, precluding a larger adoption of the theoretical tools developed by empiricists. This package provides a complete toolbox for modelling interaction effects between species, and calculate fitness and niche differences. The functions are flexible, may accept covariates, and different fitting algorithms can be used. A full description of the underlying methods is available in Garc√≠a-Callejas, D., Godoy, O., and Bartomeus, I. (2020) \doi{10.1111/2041-210X.13443}. Furthermore, the package provides a series of functions to calculate dynamics for stage-structured populations across sites.
