#cxr

This package should be able to

[X] Use real and simulated data
[X] Calculate pairwise competition parameters (alpha) and max reproductive rates (lambda) from observational data by treatment + Add stouffer neg bin model (only if easy)
[ ] Plot alpha and lambda  mediated by treatment.  
[ ] Compare models via AIC    
[ ] Calculate chessonian coexistence landscapes / values (plot + values)  pairwise  
[?] Add plot in continous (from coex to not coex in the presence of treatment)  
[X] predict site specific values (related to above)  
[ ] Check strcutural stability of ecological communities.    
[?] Translate coex to NMDS And unidimensional plots.  

To Do:
[ ] Documentation  
[ ] Separate function from processes (vignettes)  
[ ] Unit testing  
[ ] Package extras (Code of conduct, news, licence, etc...)  
[ ] Liberate Jose's data.
