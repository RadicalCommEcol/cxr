This package should be able to

[X] Use real and simulated data with any number of environmental covariates  
[X] Calculate pairwise competition parameters (alpha) and max reproductive rates (lambda) from observational data by treatment  
[X] Allow the optimization of subsets of parameters instead of the whole set (e.g. if there are field estimates for lambda)  
[X] Estimate competitive effects and responses per species  
[ ] Plot alpha and lambda  mediated by treatment.  
[ ] Compare models via AIC    
[ ] Calculate chessonian coexistence landscapes / values (plot + values)  pairwise  
[?] Add plot in continous (from coex to not coex in the presence of treatment)  
[X] predict site specific values (related to above)  
[ ] Check strcutural stability of ecological communities.    
[?] Translate coex to NMDS And unidimensional plots.  
[ ] Sensitivity analysis

Vignetes:
[ ] Estimate parameters
[ ] Plot competitive effects (Fitnes, coex plot, coex biplot)
[ ] Predict

To Do:
[ ] Documentation  
[X] Separate function from processes (vignettes)  
[ ] Unit testing  
[ ] Package extras (Code of conduct, news, licence, etc...)  
[ ] Liberate Jose's data.
