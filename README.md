This package should be able to

[X] Calculate pairwise competition parameters (alpha) and max reproductive rates (lambda) from observational data by treatment 
[ ] Plot alpha and lambda  mediated by treatment.
[ ] Compare models via AIC  
[ ] Calculate chessonian coexistence landscapes  (plot + values)  pairwise
[ ] Add plot in continous (from coex to not coex in the presence of treatment)
[ ] predict site specific values (related to above)
[ ] Check strcutural stability of ecological communities.  
[ ] Translate coex to NMDS And unidimensional plots.
