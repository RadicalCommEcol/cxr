Description: Recent developments in modern coexistence theory has advanced 
    our understanding on how species are able to persist and co-occur 
    with other species at varying abundances. However, applying this 
    mathematical framework to empirical data is still challenging, 
    precluding a larger adoption of the theoretical tools developed 
    by empiricists. This package provides a complete toolbox for modelling 
    interaction effects between species, and calculate fitness and 
    niche differences. 
    The functions are flexible, may accept covariates, 
    and different fitting algorithms can be used.
